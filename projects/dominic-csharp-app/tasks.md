## Task Tracking Tips

1. **Be Specific:** "Implement user authentication" → "Implement JWT token generation with 60min expiry"
2. **Estimate Time:** Helps with planning and tracking velocity
3. **Note Dependencies:** Avoid starting tasks that are blocked
4. **Document After Completion:** Use `/learn` to save work in memory/episodic/
5. **Link to Patterns:** Reference patterns.md when applicable
6. **Review Regularly:** Don't let this list become stale

---

## Integration with Second Brain

- **After completing task:** Run `/learn` to extract patterns and save to memory/episodic/
- **Starting new conversation:** Use @-mentions to load context from memory/episodic/
- **Task complexity > 15 min:** Use `/plan [task]` → `/step` workflow
- **Pattern discovered:** Document in `patterns.md`
- **Architecture decision:** Update `context.md`

---

## Progress Tracking

**Velocity:** [To be calculated after a few weeks]
- Average tasks completed per week: TBD
- Average time per task: TBD

**Burndown:**

## Notes

- Use `/learn` to document completed work in memory/episodic/ after finishing tasks
- Use @-mentions to restore task context in new conversations
- Review and update this file at least weekly
- Don't be afraid to delete tasks that are no longer relevant
- Celebrate completed tasks - you're making progress!
