## Architecture & Design

**Architecture Pattern:**
- [e.g., Layered Architecture, Clean Architecture, MVC]

**Project Structure:**
\`\`\`

├── ProjectName.Domain/        # Business entities and interfaces
├── ProjectName.Application/   # Business logic and services
├── ProjectName.Infrastructure/# Data access, external services
├── ProjectName.Web/           # Presentation layer (MVC/API)
└── ProjectName.Tests/         # Unit and integration tests
\`\`\`

**Design Principles:**
- SOLID principles (where applicable)
- Dependency Injection
- Repository pattern (if using)
- [Other patterns you're following]

## Key Decisions & Rationale

**Technical Decisions:**

1. **Decision:** [e.g., "Using Entity Framework Core instead of Dapper"]
   - **Reason:** [e.g., "Better for rapid development, built-in migrations, strong typing"]
   - **Trade-off:** [e.g., "Slightly lower performance, but development speed matters more"]

2. **Decision:** [Another key decision you've made]
   - **Reason:** [Why]
   - **Trade-off:** [What you're giving up]

## Constraints & Challenges

**Technical Constraints:**
- Must run on Windows 10
- [Database size/performance requirements]
- [Response time requirements]
- [Concurrent user requirements]

**Business Constraints:**
- Building solo (limited time)
- Working on side business alongside full-time job
- Need to move fast to achieve financial freedom goals
- Budget constraints for hosting/services

**Current Challenges:**
1. **Challenge:** Managing increasing project complexity
   - **Mitigation:** Using Second Brain for context preservation

2. **Challenge:** [Another challenge]
   - **Mitigation:** [How you're addressing it]

---

## Development Workflow

**Daily Workflow:**
1. Check `/overview` for urgent tasks
2. Use `/context-save` before conversation limits
3. Apply learned patterns from `patterns.md`
4. Run `/learn` after completing features
5. Commit code with meaningful messages

**Code Standards:**
- XML documentation comments for public methods
- PascalCase for public members, camelCase for private
- Async/await for all I/O operations
- Meaningful variable and method names
- Single Responsibility Principle

**Testing Strategy:**
- [Unit tests for business logic]
- [Integration tests for data access]
- [Manual testing for UI]
- [Coverage target: e.g., 70%+]

## Context for AI Assistant

**What Claude should know:**
1. **Developer Level:** Non-coder with industry experience, learning C# development
2. **Time Constraints:** Limited time due to full-time job, need efficient solutions
3. **Primary Pain Point:** Context loss between conversations (use context-snapshots!)
4. **Learning Style:** Practical, hands-on, prefers working examples
5. **Code Preferences:**
   - Readability over cleverness
   - Well-commented code
   - Follow C# conventions and best practices
   - XML documentation for public APIs

**Integration with Second Brain:**
- Always suggest `/context-save` when approaching conversation limits
- Extract patterns to `patterns.md` after completing features
- Link decisions to this context file
- Update tasks in `tasks.md` as work progresses
