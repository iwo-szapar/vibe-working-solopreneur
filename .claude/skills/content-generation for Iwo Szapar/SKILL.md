# Content Generation Skill

Create high-performing professional content using proven frameworks, validation scoring, and multi-platform distribution.

## What This Skill Does

**Core Capability**: Generate and validate content on any topic using:
- 6 proven content formulas (Decision Documentation, Failure Arbitrage, Strategic Controversy, etc.)
- 3-part validation system scoring 0-100
- Multi-platform optimization (LinkedIn, Newsletter, Twitter, YouTube)
- Content multiplication (1 piece → 15+ formats)

**Interactive Workflow**: Works in 5 collaborative steps with user feedback at each phase (see Interactive Creation Workflow below)

**Not limited to**: Any specific topic, project, or company. Works for any professional content on any subject.

## When to Activate

✅ **Use this skill when**:
- Creating LinkedIn posts, newsletters, or social media content
- Writing thought leadership content on any topic
- Validating content before publishing (get 0-100 score)
- Repurposing long-form content to multiple platforms
- Need viral hook patterns or engagement mechanics
- Creating educational, business, lifestyle, or personal development content

❌ **Don't use for**:
- Technical documentation (API docs, code comments)
- Code tutorials or programming guides
- Direct product marketing copy (landing pages, sales emails)

## Interactive Creation Workflow

**IMPORTANT**: This skill works in 5 collaborative steps. **Always wait for user approval** before moving to next step.

### Step 1: Brainstorm & Clarify (Discovery)

**What to do**:
- Ask about the topic/idea
- Understand user's goal (engagement? thought leadership? conversion?)
- Identify available data sources
- Clarify personal experiences to include
- Determine urgency/timing

**Questions to ask**:
```
1. What topic or idea do you want to explore?
2. What's your goal? (engagement/shares/saves/conversions/thought leadership)
3. Platform? (LinkedIn/Newsletter/Twitter/YouTube)
4. Do you have data to support this? (AIMI data/research/personal experience)
5. What's your current take or hypothesis?
6. Any specific stories/examples you want to include?
7. Target audience? (Founders/Executives/Individual contributors/etc.)
```

**Output**: Clear understanding of direction

**User action required**: Answer questions, confirm direction

### Step 2: Formula & Angle Selection (Strategy)

**What to do**:
- Suggest 2-3 appropriate content formulas based on user's answers
- Explain why each formula fits (or doesn't)
- Recommend best formula with reasoning
- Identify contrarian angle or unique perspective

**Present options**:
```
Based on what you shared, here are 3 options:

Option 1: [Formula name]
- Why it fits: [reasoning]
- Angle: [contrarian/unique take]
- Estimated engagement: [High/Medium]

Option 2: [Formula name]
- Why it fits: [reasoning]
- Angle: [contrarian/unique take]
- Estimated engagement: [High/Medium]

Option 3: [Formula name]
- Why it fits: [reasoning]
- Angle: [contrarian/unique take]
- Estimated engagement: [High/Medium]

My recommendation: Option [X] because [specific reasoning]

Which direction feels right?
```

**Output**: Agreed-upon formula and angle

**User action required**: Choose formula or suggest adjustments

### Step 3: Hook Generation (Attention)

**What to do**:
- Generate 5-7 hook variations using viral patterns
- Score each hook (Pattern Match + Curiosity + Specificity + Emotion)
- Explain why each works (or doesn't)
- Recommend top 2-3

**Present hooks**:
```
Here are 7 hook options (scored 0-100):

1. [Hook text] - Score: 85/100
   Pattern: Contrarian Statement (#2)
   Why it works: [specific reasoning]
   Curiosity gap: [what makes you want to read more]

2. [Hook text] - Score: 82/100
   Pattern: Data Teaser (#6)
   Why it works: [specific reasoning]
   Curiosity gap: [what makes you want to read more]

[... 5 more hooks with scores ...]

Top recommendations: #1 or #3

Which hook resonates with you? Or want variations on any?
```

**Output**: Selected hook + re-hook (if needed)

**User action required**: Choose hook or request variations

### Step 4: Structure & Outline (Framework)

**What to do**:
- Create detailed outline following chosen formula
- Map out each section with key points
- Identify where data/examples go
- Show engagement triggers (save/share/comment points)
- Estimate validation score

**Present structure**:
```
Here's the structure for [Formula name]:

HOOK (approved):
[Selected hook text]

RE-HOOK (if needed):
[2-3 variations to choose from]

SECTION 1: [Formula section name]
- Key point 1: [with data source or example]
- Key point 2: [with data source or example]
- Engagement trigger: [what makes this save-worthy/shareable]

SECTION 2: [Formula section name]
- Key point 1: [with data source or example]
- Key point 2: [with data source or example]
- Engagement trigger: [comment trigger]

[... remaining sections ...]

CTA:
- Option A: [Direct ask]
- Option B: [Soft engagement]

Character count: ~1800 (LinkedIn optimal)
Estimated validation score: 78-85/100

Approve structure? Any sections to adjust?
```

**Output**: Approved outline

**User action required**: Approve or request changes to structure

### Step 5: Final Content Generation (Execution)

**What to do**:
- Write complete content following approved structure
- Apply voice & style rules (5 Laws, no AI clichés, no em dashes)
- Include all data/examples from outline
- Format for chosen platform
- Run full 3-part validation
- Provide final score + recommendations

**Present final content**:
```
Here's your complete [Platform] post:

## Validation Score: [X]/100

**Component Scores**:
• Viral Hook: [X]/100 (40% weight)
• Creator Archetype: [X]/100 (25% weight)
• Engagement Mechanics: [X]/100 (35% weight)

**Recommendation**: [Publish now / Minor tweaks / Major revision]

**Strengths**:
1. [Specific strength]
2. [Specific strength]
3. [Specific strength]

**Potential Improvements**:
1. [Specific suggestion if score <85]
2. [Specific suggestion if score <85]

**Metadata**:

- Archetype: [Creator archetype]

Ready to publish? Or want adjustments?
```

**Output**: Final validated content ready to publish

**User action required**: Approve for publishing or request edits

## Workflow Rules

**Always follow these rules**:

1. **Never skip steps** - Go through all 5 steps sequentially
2. **Wait for user input** - Don't proceed to next step without approval
3. **Ask clarifying questions** - If anything is unclear, ask before proceeding
4. **Offer options** - Don't assume one approach, give 2-3 choices
5. **Explain reasoning** - Say WHY you recommend something
6. **Score transparently** - Show validation scores, explain what they mean
7. **Be honest about weaknesses** - If hook scores low, say so and iterate
8. **Invite feedback** - End each step with question for user input

## Quick Start Examples

**Example 1: Starting fresh**
```
User: "Help me create a LinkedIn post about AI adoption challenges"

Agent (Step 1):
Great! Let me ask a few questions to nail the direction:

1. What specific AI adoption challenge interests you most?
   - Leadership resistance?
   - Training gaps?
   - Tool overload?
   - Something else?

2. Do you have data or personal experience on this?
3. What's your goal - engagement, thought leadership, or conversions?
4. Any contrarian angle you're thinking?
```

**Example 2: User has rough idea**
```
User: "I want to write about how executives overestimate their AI maturity"

Agent (Step 1):
Perfect topic with strong contrarian potential!

Quick questions:
1. Do you have data on this? (AIMI assessments showing the gap?)
2. Specific examples you've observed?
3. Is this for LinkedIn, newsletter, or both?
4. Goal: Challenge executives directly or educate decision-makers?
5. Any personal experience with this pattern?

[Wait for answers before moving to Step 2]
```
