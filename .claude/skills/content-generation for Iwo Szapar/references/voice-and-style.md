# Voice & Style Guidelines

Writing rules and authenticity guidelines for AI thought leadership content.

## The 5 Laws of Better Writing

### Law 1: Object Then Action

**Rule**: Always use active voice.

**Why**: Brains imagine the object before the action. Active voice matches natural cognition.

**Examples**:
- ✅ "The boy hit the ball"
- ❌ "The ball was hit by the boy"
- ✅ "AI transforms productivity"
- ❌ "Productivity is transformed by AI"

**Application**: Scan every sentence. If you see "was [verb]ed by", rewrite.

### Law 2: Remove Needless Words

**Rule**: Every word must earn its place.

**Test**: If you remove a word and the sentence still makes sense, delete it.

**Examples**:
- ✅ "If you remove the word, it's useless"
- ❌ "If you can remove the word, then it's useless" (the word "can" is useless)
- ✅ "AI adoption requires change management"
- ❌ "AI adoption typically requires careful change management"

**Common culprits**:
- "very", "really", "quite", "just", "that"
- "in order to" → "to"
- "due to the fact that" → "because"
- "at this point in time" → "now"

### Law 3: No Adverbs

**Rule**: Adverbs describe verbs and are almost always unnecessary.

**Stephen King quote**: "Adverbs pave the way to hell."

**Examples**:
- ✅ "He ran"
- ❌ "He ran very fast"
- ✅ "She spoke"
- ❌ "She spoke confidently"

**Why it matters**: If you need an adverb, you chose the wrong verb.

**Better approach**:
- "He ran" vs "He ran quickly" → "He sprinted"
- "She spoke" vs "She spoke softly" → "She whispered"

### Law 4: Write Simply

**Rule**: Aim for 4th to 7th grade reading level.

**Why**: Simple ≠ Simplistic. Simple = Clear.

**Tool**: Use Hemingway app (free) to check readability.

**Examples**:
- ✅ "Use this method"
- ❌ "Utilize this methodology"
- ✅ "Help"
- ❌ "Facilitate"
- ✅ "Use"
- ❌ "Leverage"

**Hard words → Simple words**:
- "Utilize" → "Use"
- "Implement" → "Use" or "Start"
- "Facilitate" → "Help"
- "Optimize" → "Improve"
- "Leverage" → "Use"

### Law 5: Hit the Reader

**Rule**: First sentence must punch them in the face.

**Why**: You have <2 seconds to hook attention.

**Examples**:
- ✅ "AI training programs waste money."
- ❌ "In this post, I'd like to share some thoughts about AI training programs and their effectiveness."
- ✅ "Remote teams adopt AI faster."
- ❌ "Based on my research, I've noticed an interesting trend in how remote teams approach AI adoption."

**Opening sentence checklist**:
- [ ] Under 15 words
- [ ] Makes bold claim
- [ ] Creates curiosity
- [ ] No throat-clearing ("In this post...", "I want to share...")

## AI Clichés Blacklist

**NEVER use these phrases** (immediate AI giveaway):

### Banned Phrases

**Transition/Filler**:
- "Let's dive in"
- "Let's dive deeper"
- "At the end of the day"
- "In today's world"
- "In this day and age"

**Hype Words**:
- "Game-changing"
- "Revolutionary"
- "Groundbreaking"
- "Cutting-edge"
- "State-of-the-art"
- "Next-level"
- "Unlock" (unless literal locks)
- "Unleash"

**Fake Conversation**:
- "And the best part?"
- "The real change?"
- "The results?"
- "Wondering what happened next?"
- "XYZ isn't just ABC—it's doing bla bla"

**Corporate Speak**:
- "Synergy"
- "Leverage" (use "use")
- "Utilize" (use "use")
- "Paradigm shift" (describe the shift instead)
- "Circle back"
- "Take this offline"

### Why These Fail

These phrases signal:
1. AI-generated content (not human)
2. Marketing fluff (not substance)
3. Fake enthusiasm (not authentic)

**Better alternatives**:
- Instead of "Let's dive in" → Just start
- Instead of "Game-changing" → Describe the specific change
- Instead of "And the best part?" → State the benefit directly
- Instead of "Leverage AI" → "Use AI"

## Grammar Rules

### Rule 1: Never Use Em Dashes (—)

**Why**: Overused in AI writing. Human signal lost.

**What to do instead**:
- Split into two sentences
- Use comma
- Use semicolon
- Use colon

**Examples**:
- ❌ "AI adoption is hard—but worth it"
- ✅ "AI adoption is hard. But worth it."
- ❌ "The problem—lack of training—is fixable"
- ✅ "The problem (lack of training) is fixable"

### Rule 2: Minimize Hyphens

**Only use in**:
- Standard compound words: "well-being", "decision-making"
- Compound adjectives before noun: "AI-powered tools"

**Don't use when**:
- After noun: "tools that are AI powered" (no hyphen)
- Made-up compounds: "growth-hacking" → "growth hacking"

### Rule 3: Casual Grammar OK

**It's fine to**:
- Start sentences with "And" or "But"
- Use sentence fragments for emphasis
- End sentences with prepositions
- Use contractions ("don't", "it's", "we're")

**Example**:
"But here's the thing. AI adoption isn't something you do to people. It's something you do with them."

### Rule 4: Simplify Complex Sentences

**Before**: "If you can remove the word, then it's useless, and you should delete it."

**After**: "If you remove the word and it still makes sense, delete it."

**Rule**: One idea per sentence. Two sentences > one complex sentence.

## Sentence Structure

### Length Variation

**Mix it up**:
- Short: 5-8 words (impact)
- Medium: 12-18 words (flow)
- Long: 20-25 words (complexity)

**Example**:
"AI fails. (3 words)
Not because the technology doesn't work. (6 words)
It fails because companies skip the fundamentals: clear use cases, proper training, and cultural readiness. (17 words)"

### Paragraph Length

**Rule**: 2-3 sentences maximum per paragraph.

**Why**: Mobile readability + scanning.

**Example**:
❌ One paragraph:
"AI adoption is challenging. Companies rush to implement tools without strategy. Training is minimal. Change management is ignored. Then they wonder why adoption fails. The problem isn't AI. It's process."

✅ Multiple paragraphs:
"AI adoption is challenging.

Companies rush to implement tools without strategy. Training is minimal. Change management is ignored.

Then they wonder why adoption fails. The problem isn't AI. It's process."

## Formatting Rules

### Use Lists

**When**: 3+ related items

**Format**:
- Bullets for unordered
- Numbers for sequence/priority

**Example**:
"AI adoption fails for three reasons:
1. No clear use case
2. Insufficient training
3. Poor change management"

### White Space

**Rule**: Use generously for scanning.

**Tactics**:
- Line break between paragraphs
- Separate sections with ---
- Use headers (##, ###)
- Don't write "walls of text"

### Emphasis

**Bold**: Key points, numbers, important phrases
**Italics**: Rarely (feels academic)
**CAPS**: Never (feels like shouting)

**Example**:
"We analyzed **250K assessments** across **75 countries**. The data is clear: remote teams adopt AI **40% faster** than co-located teams."

## Authenticity Rules

### Never Fabricate

**Don't invent**:
- Family members or personal circumstances
- Private conversations or moments
- Specific life events not verifiable
- Personal habits or routines
- Unnamed "studies" or "research"

**OK to use**:
- Professional journey (verifiable)
- Business decisions (documented)
- Project data (real numbers)
- Industry observations (can be validated)

**Example**:
- ❌ "When my daughter asked me about AI..."
- ✅ "When analyzing our data from 250K assessments..."
- ❌ "A study I read said..."
- ✅ "Research from Stanford (2024) found..." [cite actual source]

### Keep It Real

**Voice checklist**:
- [ ] Sounds like something I'd say in person
- [ ] No fake enthusiasm or over-promises
- [ ] Uses neutral, honest descriptions
- [ ] Admits uncertainty when appropriate
- [ ] Says "I don't know" or "I could be wrong"

**Examples**:
- ❌ "This revolutionary app will change your life!"
- ✅ "This app helps you stay organized."
- ❌ "I'm absolutely certain that..."
- ✅ "Based on our data, it appears..."

## Voice Markers for AI Content

### What to Include

**Data Specificity**:
- Exact numbers: "250K assessments" not "lots of data"
- Geographic scope: "75 countries" not "global"
- Time frames: "Past 12 months" not "recently"

**Personal Experience**:
- Specific projects: "Building AI Maturity Index taught me..."
- Geographic diversity: "Living in 15 countries showed..."
- Role specificity: "As Saudi AI Advisor, I've seen..."

**Contrarian Insights**:
- Challenge mainstream: "Most people believe X. Data shows Y."
- Industry gaps: "Nobody talks about..."
- Professional taboos: "The truth consultants won't say..."

**Vulnerability**:
- Specific failures: "We spent $50K on..."
- Ongoing struggles: "I'm still figuring out..."
- Uncertainty: "I'm torn between X and Y"

### What to Avoid

**Vague Claims**:
- "Many people say..."
- "Studies show..."
- "Experts believe..."
- "It's well-known that..."

**Empty Superlatives**:
- "Amazing"
- "Incredible"
- "Awesome"
- "Fantastic"
- "Best ever"

**Hedging Language** (unless genuine uncertainty):
- "I think maybe possibly..."
- "It seems like it might be..."
- "Perhaps it could be said that..."

## Quality Checks

**Before publishing, verify**:

- [ ] Every sentence uses active voice
- [ ] No unnecessary words (test each one)
- [ ] No adverbs (unless absolutely necessary)
- [ ] Reading level is 4th-7th grade
- [ ] First sentence punches hard
- [ ] No AI clichés from blacklist
- [ ] No em dashes (—)
- [ ] Minimal hyphens (standard compounds only)
- [ ] No fabricated personal details
- [ ] Specific data/numbers included
- [ ] Sounds like something I'd say in person

**If any check fails**: Revise before publishing.

## Reading Level Test

**Use Hemingway App**:
1. Paste content
2. Check grade level (target: 4-7)
3. Check "hard to read" sentences (yellow)
4. Check "very hard to read" sentences (red)
5. Revise until clean

**Quick test**:
- Yellow sentences: Simplify or break apart
- Red sentences: Always revise
- Grade 8+: Too complex, simplify
- Grade 3-: Too simple, add nuance

## Style Examples

### Before (AI-Generated Feel)

"In today's rapidly evolving AI landscape, organizations are increasingly leveraging cutting-edge technologies to unlock unprecedented value and drive transformational outcomes. However, many companies struggle to effectively implement these game-changing solutions due to a variety of complex challenges that they face."

**Problems**:
- AI clichés: "rapidly evolving", "leveraging", "cutting-edge", "unlock", "game-changing"
- Passive voice: "are leveraging"
- Unnecessary words: "increasingly", "effectively", "variety of complex"
- Generic: No specific claim
- Grade level: 12+

### After (Human Voice)

"AI adoption fails.

Companies buy tools but skip fundamentals. No clear use cases. Minimal training. Poor change management.

Our data from 250K assessments shows the pattern. The technology works. The process doesn't."

**Improvements**:
- Active voice throughout
- Every word earns its place
- No adverbs
- Grade level: 5
- Specific (250K assessments)
- Bold claim (AI adoption fails)
