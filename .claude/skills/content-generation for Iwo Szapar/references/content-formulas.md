# Content Formulas

6 proven content formulas based on LinkedIn Psychology principles. Each formula creates specific psychological triggers for engagement.

## Formula 1: Decision Documentation

**Psychological Trigger**: Futures Market (people invest in your trajectory)

**When to Use**:
- Major strategic decisions with 48-72 hour window
- Product pivots or business dilemmas
- Career/life crossroads moments
- Resource allocation choices

**Structure**:
```
PART 1 (Initial Post):
Hook: "I have [TIMEFRAME] to decide [MAJOR DECISION]"
Context: Why this decision matters
Data: Information/insights informing the choice
Dilemma: Why both options are compelling
Stakes: What's at risk
Ask: "What would you do? Here's what I'm weighing..."

[Wait 24-48 hours - let engagement build]

PART 2 (Follow-up Post):
Decision: "Here's what we chose and why"
Surprise: "What I didn't expect during this process"
Learning: "What this taught me about [broader lesson]"
Gratitude: Thank those who provided input
Next: "Here's what happens now..."
```

**Examples**:
- "I have 72 hours to decide: expand to 20 new countries or go deep in our top 5?"
- "48 hours to choose: bootstrap for 2 more years or raise a seed round?"
- "This Friday I decide: hire 5 specialists or 2 generalists for the team?"

**Why It Works**:
- People feel like board members (not students)
- Creates anticipation and return visitors
- Vulnerability + stakes = emotional investment
- Two-part structure builds narrative arc

## Formula 2: Failure Arbitrage

**Psychological Trigger**: Reputation arbitrage (your failure validates theirs)

**When to Use**:
- Product/feature failures
- Wrong strategic assumptions
- Wasted money/time on initiatives
- Hiring mistakes or team issues
- Market misjudgments

**Structure**:
```
Hook: "We spent $[AMOUNT] on [FAILURE]" or "I wasted [TIME] on [MISTAKE]"

Story: What we tried and why it seemed smart at the time
- Context: Situation that led to decision
- Reasoning: Why we thought it would work
- Confidence: How certain we were

Fail: What actually happened
- Reality: What went wrong (data + emotion)
- Impact: Cost in money/time/opportunity
- Moment: When we realized the mistake

Lesson: What the data/experience revealed
- Pattern: Root cause analysis
- Insight: What we learned
- Framework: Mental model that emerged

Wisdom: How others can avoid this
- Warning signs: Red flags we missed
- Alternative: What to do instead
- Framework: Decision criteria to use

Insurance: "If you're thinking about [X], consider [Y] instead"
```

**Examples**:
- "We spent $50K building a feature nobody wanted. AIMI data revealed why."
- "I wasted 6 months on the wrong growth strategy. Here's what changed."
- "This hiring mistake cost us 3 months. The pattern I should have seen."

**Why It Works**:
- Your failure = psychological insurance for readers
- Specific numbers (time/money) create credibility
- Framework at end = actionable value
- Vulnerability without victimhood

## Formula 3: Strategic Controversy

**Psychological Trigger**: Professionally taboo truth (risky but safe)

**When to Use**:
- Industry beliefs you can disprove with data
- Common practices that don't work
- Conventional wisdom that's outdated
- Professional assumptions worth challenging

**Structure**:
```
Hook: "[PROFESSIONALLY TABOO CLAIM]"
- Must be bold but defensible
- Industry-specific (not political)
- Example: "Most AI training programs waste money"

Expectation: "Most people believe [MAINSTREAM VIEW]"
- State the conventional wisdom
- Show how widespread this belief is
- Acknowledge why it seems true

Data: "Our data from [SOURCE] shows [OPPOSITE]"
- Specific statistics
- Sample size and credibility
- Clear contradiction to mainstream view
- Example: "250K assessments across 75 countries show..."

Why: Explain the gap between belief and reality
- Psychology: Why people believe the wrong thing
- Incentives: Who benefits from the myth
- Structure: Systems that reinforce the belief
- History: How this belief became mainstream

Implication: What this means for your audience
- Individual impact
- Industry impact
- Opportunity cost of following mainstream

Debate: "Agree or disagree?"
- Invite discussion
- Acknowledge other perspectives
- Open to being wrong (but confident in data)
```

**Examples**:
- "AI tools reduce productivity. Our 250K assessments prove it."
- "Remote teams adopt AI faster than co-located. Here's why."
- "Executives overestimate their AI maturity by 2+ levels. The data is clear."

**Why It Works**:
- Contrarian enough to stand out
- Safe enough to share (backed by data)
- Creates "agree/disagree" engagement
- Positions you as truth-teller

## Formula 4: Inside Baseball

**Psychological Trigger**: Insider intelligence (equity partner feeling)

**When to Use**:
- Industry patterns most don't see
- Behind-the-scenes how things actually work
- Gap between what's said publicly vs reality
- Proprietary data insights
- Process knowledge from experience

**Structure**:
```
Hook: "Nobody talks about [INDUSTRY REALITY]"
- Specific gap in public discourse
- Something everyone experiences but doesn't discuss

Surface: What everyone SAYS happens
- Public narrative
- Marketing claims
- Conventional advice
- What consultants sell

Reality: What ACTUALLY happens
- Data that contradicts surface narrative
- Specific examples
- Percentage/numbers
- Example: "Our data shows reality is opposite"

Why: The gap exists because...
- Incentives: Who benefits from the myth
- Structure: System dynamics
- Psychology: Cognitive biases
- Politics: What can't be said publicly

Intel: "Here's what you need to know..."
- 3-5 specific insights
- Actionable intelligence
- Pattern recognition
- Decision criteria

Invitation: "You're now an insider to this pattern"
- Make reader feel like equity partner
- Not a student, but peer
- Shared knowledge creates bond
```

**Examples**:
- "What 250K assessments reveal about executive buy-in that nobody talks about"
- "The real reason AI pilots fail (procurement process no one mentions)"
- "Why consultants sell AI maturity wrong (the incentive nobody discusses)"

**Why It Works**:
- Makes audience feel like insiders (not consumers)
- Intelligence > tips (partnership > transaction)
- Reveals how industry actually works
- Creates "I knew it!" validation moment

## Formula 5: Trajectory Sharing

**Psychological Trigger**: Open-ended story (invest before it ends)

**When to Use**:
- Quarterly journey updates
- Ongoing learning processes
- Multi-year project progress
- Career evolution stories
- Skill development narratives

**Structure**:
```
Hook: "X years building [PROJECT] taught me [UNEXPECTED LESSON]"
- Time frame establishes credibility
- Unexpected = curiosity gap
- Lesson = promise of value

Journey: Where we started vs where we are
- Origin story (briefly)
- Key milestones hit
- Metric: Growth in numbers
- Contrast: Then vs now

Surprise: What I didn't expect to learn
- 2-3 counterintuitive insights
- Things that contradicted assumptions
- Lessons only visible in hindsight
- Data that changed perspective

Current: "Here's where I'm struggling now..."
- Present challenges (vulnerability)
- Specific problems being worked on
- Uncertainty about best path
- Learning in progress

Future: "I'm torn between [X] and [Y]"
- Open questions
- Multiple possible paths
- Decision points ahead
- Invite input

Invitation: "Come along for the next chapter"
- Ongoing story
- Future updates promised
- Reader as fellow traveler
```

**Examples**:
- "3 years building AIMI taught me AI maturity is nothing like I thought"
- "15 countries, 1 insight: Remote work adoption follows cultural patterns, not technology"
- "Year 2 as Saudi AI Advisor: What I got completely wrong about Middle East tech"

**Why It Works**:
- Investment in trajectory (not just outcome)
- Vulnerability creates connection
- Open-ended = reason to follow
- Progress visible but destination uncertain

## Formula 6: Subtle Anxiety (Aspiration + Achievability)

**Psychological Trigger**: "I SHOULD + I COULD" activation

**When to Use**:
- Motivational content with clear steps
- Success stories with actionable process
- Impressive results with accessible method
- Outcome + system sharing

**Structure**:
```
Hook: [IMPRESSIVE OUTCOME] - The "I SHOULD" trigger
- Specific metric
- Time frame
- Impressive but not impossible
- Example: "Teams using AIMI benchmark monthly saw 40% maturity gain in 90 days"

Difficulty: "But here's what it actually took..." - Relatability
- Show the challenge (not easy)
- Time investment
- Obstacles faced
- Why most don't do it

Process: Breakdown of how - Demystify
- 3-5 specific steps
- Timeline for each
- Resources needed
- Detailed enough to follow

Access: "Here's how you can do this" - The "I COULD" trigger
- No special access needed
- Reasonable time/money required
- Example: "15 minutes monthly, no budget required"
- Clear starting point

Barrier: "What's stopping you?" - Activation
- Address objections
- Remove excuses
- Challenge to act
- Accountability nudge
```

**Examples**:
- "40% AI maturity gain in 90 days. Free. 15 minutes monthly. What's stopping you?"
- "10x content output in 2 hours daily. No team. Here's the system."
- "From 5K to 50K followers in 6 months. Broke. Solo. The exact process."

**Why It Works**:
- Creates aspiration (SHOULD do this)
- Shows achievability (COULD do this)
- Sweet spot: Not too easy, not too hard
- Removes excuses with clear process

## Choosing the Right Formula

**Use Decision Documentation when**: You have a real decision pending and can create two-part narrative

**Use Failure Arbitrage when**: You have specific failure with data/learnings to share

**Use Strategic Controversy when**: You have data to challenge widely-held belief

**Use Inside Baseball when**: You have proprietary insights about how industry actually works

**Use Trajectory Sharing when**: You want to update on ongoing journey with vulnerability

**Use Subtle Anxiety when**: You have impressive results with replicable system

## Content Mix

**Monthly distribution**:
- 40% Strategic Controversy (contrarian core)
- 25% Decision Documentation (futures market)
- 20% Inside Baseball (unique intelligence)
- 15% Failure Arbitrage + Trajectory (vulnerability)

Subtle Anxiety: Use sparingly (1-2x monthly) - can feel pushy if overused
