- Rank by checkmarks (5-6 = proceed)
- Assign to days (Monday = Contrarian, Tuesday = Decision, etc.)
- Note data needed for each

**Output**: 5 content ideas mapped to Mon-Fri with formulas chosen

## Content Formula Selection Workflow

**When choosing which formula to use**:

### Step 1: Identify Your Input

**Do you have**:
- [ ] Real decision pending (48-72 hour window)?
- [ ] Specific failure/mistake to share?
- [ ] Data contradicting mainstream belief?
- [ ] Proprietary industry insights?
- [ ] Personal journey update?
- [ ] Impressive results with replicable system?

### Step 2: Match to Formula

**If real decision** → Decision Documentation
- Best for: Strategic choices, resource allocation, pivots
- Requires: Genuine uncertainty, 2-part structure (decision + resolution)

**If specific failure** → Failure Arbitrage
- Best for: Wasted money/time, wrong assumptions, mistakes
- Requires: Honesty, specific numbers, lessons learned

**If data vs. mainstream** → Strategic Controversy
- Best for: Challenging conventional wisdom
- Requires: Data to back claim, professionally safe topic

**If industry insights** → Inside Baseball
- Best for: Gap between public narrative and reality
- Requires: Proprietary knowledge, specific examples

**If personal journey** → Trajectory Sharing
- Best for: Quarterly updates, ongoing learning
- Requires: Vulnerability, progress metrics, future uncertainty

**If impressive + replicable** → Subtle Anxiety
- Best for: Motivational with clear process
- Requires: Specific results, detailed steps, accessibility

### Step 3: Verify Fit

**Check**:
- [ ] Do I have all elements of chosen formula?
- [ ] Can I execute formula authentically?
- [ ] Is timing right for this formula?

**If missing elements**: Choose different formula

## Validation Workflow

**Before publishing any content**:

### Step 1: Run Pre-Flight Checklist (5 min)

From SKILL.md:
- [ ] Contrarian: Challenges mainstream thinking?
- [ ] Data-backed: Can support with statistics?
- [ ] Unique: Can only this creator write this?
- [ ] Actionable: Can readers implement this week?
- [ ] Relevant: Timely and audience-appropriate?
- [ ] Engaging: Will spark discussion?

**If 5-6 checks**: Proceed to validation
**If 3-4 checks**: Refine angle, retry
**If 0-2 checks**: Choose different topic

### Step 2: 3-Part Evaluation (10 min)

**Evaluation 1: Viral Hook Pattern**
See `validation-system.md` for details
- Pattern Match: 0-40
- Curiosity Gap: 0-30
- Specificity: 0-20
- Emotional Trigger: 0-10
- Total: 0-100

**Evaluation 2: Creator Archetype**
- Archetype Match: 0-25
- Formula Execution: 0-40
- Voice Consistency: 0-20
- Length Optimization: 0-15
- Total: 0-100

**Evaluation 3: Engagement Mechanics**
- Save Triggers: 0-25
- Share Triggers: 0-25
- Comment Triggers: 0-20
- Visual Optimization: 0-15
- CTA Effectiveness: 0-15
- Total: 0-100

### Step 3: Calculate Composite Score

**Formula**: (Hook × 0.40) + (Archetype × 0.25) + (Engagement × 0.35)

**Example**:
- Hook: 90/100
- Archetype: 85/100
- Engagement: 72/100

Composite = (90 × 0.40) + (85 × 0.25) + (72 × 0.35)
= 36 + 21.25 + 25.2
= **82.45/100**

**Decision**: High quality → Publish with confidence

### Step 4: Document Score

**Add to content file**:
```markdown
## COMPOSITE SCORE: 82/100

**Component Scores**:
• Viral Hook: 90/100 (40%)
• Creator Archetype: 85/100 (25%)
• Engagement Mechanics: 72/100 (35%)

**Recommendation**: High quality → Publish

**Strengths**:
1. [Specific strength]
2. [Specific strength]
3. [Specific strength]

**Improvements**:
1. [Specific suggestion]
2. [Specific suggestion]
```

### Step 5: Iterate if Needed

**If score <70**:
1. Identify lowest-scoring component
2. Review that evaluation criteria
3. Make specific improvements
4. Re-validate
5. Repeat until 70+

**Common fixes**:
- Low hook score: Add specific number or contrarian angle
- Low archetype score: Pick ONE archetype and execute formula fully
- Low engagement score: Add direct question, improve formatting
