## When to Run

**Trigger moments**:
- Every Friday afternoon (weekly growth review)
- First of the month (monthly retrospective)
- When feeling "is this working?" (validation needed)
- Before 1-on-1 with boss (show productivity ROI)
- After major milestone (celebrate progress)

**Time investment**: < 5 seconds

**ROI**: 10-20 min/week (vs manual tracking), plus motivation boost

## Workflow Overview (13 Steps)

### 1. Count Files by Memory Type
**Tool: Bash**
```bash
find memory/semantic/patterns/ -name "*.md" | wc -l
find memory/episodic/ -name "*.md" | wc -l
find memory/procedural/ -name "*.md" | wc -l
```

**Output**: Brain size metrics

### 2. Read Pattern Confidence Data
**Tool: Read**
```bash
Read("brain-health/pattern-confidence.md")
```

**Parse**: Count patterns by confidence level (LOW/MEDIUM/HIGH)

### 3. Read Growth Log
**Tool: Read**
```bash
Read("brain-health/growth-log.md")
```

**Extract**: Weekly/monthly growth entries

### 4. Read Time Savings Metrics
**Tool: Read**
```bash
Read("brain-health/metrics.md")
```

**Calculate**:
- Time saved this week
- Time saved this month
- Cumulative time saved
- Annualized projection

### 5. Count Projects
**Tool: Read**
```bash
Read("projects/INDEX.md")
```

**Parse**: Active, paused, and completed projects

### 6. Analyze Pattern Usage
**Tool: Grep**

Search episodic memory for pattern applications:
```bash
Grep(
  pattern="Applied pattern:",
  path="memory/episodic/",
  output_mode="count"
)
```

**Calculate**: Usage frequency per pattern

### 7. Identify Domain Coverage
**Tool: Read**

Read all pattern files, extract domains:
- Development patterns (dev-patterns.md)
- Client patterns (client-patterns.md)
- Content patterns (content-patterns.md)
- Process patterns (process-patterns.md)

**Output**: Which domains are well-covered, which need growth

### 8. Calculate Annual Projections
**Math**:
```javascript
// Weekly time saved → annual projection
const weeklyTimeSaved = sumTimeSavingsThisWeek()
const annualProjection = weeklyTimeSaved * 52

// Pattern growth rate → annual projection
const patternsAddedThisMonth = countNewPatterns()
const annualPatternGrowth = patternsAddedThisMonth * 12
```

### 9. Generate Recommendations
**AI analysis** based on:
- Low confidence patterns (promote to MEDIUM/HIGH)
- Under-utilized patterns (apply more often)
- Domain gaps (missing pattern categories)
- Over-capacity projects (defer tasks)

**Output**: 3-5 actionable suggestions

### 10. Find Knowledge Graph Highlights
**Tool: Grep**

Search for interesting connections:
- Patterns applied across multiple projects
- Client patterns that became general patterns
- High-frequency pattern applications

### 11. Determine Next Milestone
**Milestones**:
1. First HIGH confidence pattern (proof of concept)
2. 10 patterns total (critical mass)
3. 10 hours saved (ROI validation)
4. 5 HIGH confidence patterns (expertise level)
5. 50 hours saved (senior efficiency)
6. 100 hours saved (mastery level)

**Calculate ETA** based on current growth rate

### 12. Assess Brain Health Score
**Formula**:
```javascript
const healthScore =
  (highConfidencePatterns * 10) +
  (mediumConfidencePatterns * 5) +
  (lowConfidencePatterns * 2) +
  (activeProjects * 3) +
  (weeklyTimeSaved * 2)

// Ratings:
// < 50: Just starting
// 50-100: Building momentum
// 100-200: Strong system
// 200+: Elite level
```

### 13. Display Comprehensive Report
Output 10-section dashboard with visualizations.
