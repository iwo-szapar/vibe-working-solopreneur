# Task Management Best Practices

Capacity management and completion strategies.

## Capacity Guidelines

### Healthy Capacity (< 15 tasks)
✅ Manageable workload
✅ Clear priorities
✅ Good completion rate

**Action**: Continue adding tasks as needed

### Warning Capacity (15-20 tasks)
⚠️ Approaching overload
⚠️ Need to prioritize

**Action**:
1. Complete 3-5 NORMAL priority tasks
2. Defer LOW priority to backlog
3. Stop adding non-essential tasks

### Over-Capacity (> 20 tasks)
❌ Too many open tasks
❌ Unclear priorities
❌ Low completion rate

**Action**:
1. **STOP** adding new tasks
2. Complete or defer 5-10 tasks
3. Archive stale tasks (> 30 days old)
4. Promote only truly urgent items

## Completion Strategies

### Daily: Complete 2-3 Tasks
- Start with 1 URGENT/HIGH
- Add 1-2 NORMAL tasks
- Avoid starting LOW unless capacity

### Weekly: Close 10-15 Tasks
- Target 70%+ completion rate
- Review and archive completed
- Defer or delete stale tasks

### Monthly: Review All Tasks
- Archive completed (move to ## Completed)
- Reassess priorities (promote/demote)
- Delete obsolete tasks

## Task Lifecycle

```
Idea → `/idea` capture
  ↓
Review → Convert to task (`/add-task`)
  ↓
Prioritize → Appears in `/overview`
  ↓
Work → `/switch` to project
  ↓
Complete → Check off `- [x]`
  ↓
Archive → Moved to ## Completed section
```

## Common Issues

### Issue: Too Many LOW Priority Tasks
**Symptom**: 30+ LOW tasks in backlog
**Fix**: Archive tasks > 90 days old, delete unlikely-to-do

### Issue: Everything is URGENT
**Symptom**: 10+ URGENT tasks
**Fix**: Re-prioritize. Only 1-2 should be truly urgent.

### Issue: Tasks Never Complete
**Symptom**: < 50% completion rate
**Fix**: Break tasks into smaller sub-tasks, estimate time better

## Metrics to Track

**Weekly**:
- Tasks added: ~15-25
- Tasks completed: ~10-15
- Completion rate: 70%+ ✅

**Monthly**:
- Total open tasks: < 15 per project ✅
- Average task age: < 14 days ✅
- Backlog size: < 20 LOW tasks ✅
