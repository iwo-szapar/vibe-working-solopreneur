# Idea Review Guide

Weekly process for reviewing and converting ideas.

## Weekly Review Cadence

**When**: Every Friday, 30 minutes
**Goal**: Convert high-value ideas to tasks, archive completed/stale ideas

## Review Process

### 1. Read All Idea Files (5 min)

```bash
Read("memory/semantic/ideas/product-ideas.md")
Read("memory/semantic/ideas/content-ideas.md")
Read("memory/semantic/ideas/business-ideas.md")
Read("memory/semantic/ideas/tech-ideas.md")
Read("memory/semantic/ideas/client-ideas.md")
Read("memory/semantic/ideas/process-ideas.md")
```

### 2. Sort by Priority (2 min)

Create temporary lists:
- HIGH priority ideas
- MEDIUM priority ideas
- LOW priority ideas

### 3. Process HIGH Priority (10 min)

For each HIGH priority idea:

**Convert to task**:
```
/add-task [project] [idea summary]
```

**Archive if completed**:
Move to "Completed Ideas" section at bottom of file

**Keep if still relevant**:
Update "Why This Matters" if context changed

### 4. Process MEDIUM Priority (8 min)

For each MEDIUM priority idea:

**Promote to HIGH** if now urgent
**Convert to task** if ready to execute
**Archive** if no longer relevant
**Keep** if still valuable but not urgent

### 5. Process LOW Priority (5 min)

For each LOW priority idea:

**Promote** if circumstances changed
**Archive after 3 months** if never promoted
**Keep** for future inspiration

## Conversion Criteria

### Convert Idea → Task When:

✅ **Clear action steps** identified
✅ **Project** is defined (know where it goes)
✅ **Ready to start** within 2 weeks
✅ **Value** is clear and justified

### Keep as Idea When:

⏸️ **Needs research** before committing
⏸️ **No project fit** yet
⏸️ **Future potential** but not now
⏸️ **Waiting for dependencies**

### Archive When:

❌ **Completed** (converted to task and finished)
❌ **No longer relevant** (context changed)
❌ **Low priority for 3+ months** (never promoted)
❌ **Duplicate** of another idea

## Example Review Session

**Starting state**: 23 ideas across all categories

**After review**:
- 5 ideas → tasks (HIGH priority, ready to go)
- 8 ideas kept (still relevant)
- 7 ideas archived (completed or stale)
- 3 ideas promoted (MEDIUM → HIGH)

**Time**: 28 minutes
**Result**: Clear action plan, cleaned-up idea backlog

## Idea Conversion Rate

**Target**: 30%+ ideas → tasks (healthy conversion)

**Track monthly**:
- Ideas captured: 15/month
- Ideas converted to tasks: 5/month
- Conversion rate: 33% ✅

**Too low (< 20%)**: Capturing too many low-value ideas
**Too high (> 50%)**: Not capturing enough exploratory ideas
