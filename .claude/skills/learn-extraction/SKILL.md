# Learning Extraction Skill

## Skill Metadata
- **Version**: 1.0.0
- **Author**: Luca's Second Brain Team
- **Category**: knowledge-extraction
- **Tags**: learning, pattern-extraction, semantic-memory, knowledge-compounding, second-brain

**Dependencies**:
- **Files**: `memory/semantic/patterns/*.md`, `memory/episodic/*/*.md`, `brain-health/growth-log.md`, `brain-health/pattern-confidence.md`

**Input Parameters**:
- `work_completed` (string, required): Description of what user just finished
- `work_type` (enum, required): code | client | content | research | other
- `challenge` (string, optional): Key challenge or root cause
- `solution` (string, optional): How user solved it
- `pattern_insight` (string, required): The pattern to remember

**Output**:
- `pattern_updated` (object): {name, old_confidence, new_confidence, examples_count}
- `episodic_memory_file` (string): Path to created experience file
- `brain_growth` (object): {total_patterns, high_confidence_count, time_saved_estimate}
- `next_application` (string): Suggestion for when to apply pattern next

**Success Metrics**:
- Pattern identification rate: 80%+
- Time per extraction: < 3 minutes
- Pattern application ROI: 10-15x return on time invested
- High confidence patterns: 30%+ of total within 12 weeks

**Examples**: See `examples/` directory (01-code-fix, 02-client-work, 03-content-creation)

**Tests**: See `tests/` directory (pattern-confidence-promotion, episodic-memory-creation, brain-health-metrics-update)

## Executive Snapshot

**Knowledge Compounding System**: Converts raw work experiences into reusable patterns stored in semantic memory. Every significant work session contains patterns worth capturing. The goal: make each project easier than the last.

**Core Philosophy**: Your brain compounds. Pattern extraction takes 2-3 minutes but saves 30-45 minutes per future application (10-15x ROI).

**Quality Standard**: Patterns must include concrete examples, time savings estimates, and clear "when to apply" guidance. Confidence levels promote automatically (LOW → MEDIUM → HIGH) based on reinforcement frequency.

---

## When to Run

**Trigger moments**:
- After fixing a tricky bug
- After completing a significant feature
- After a client meeting with new insights
- After creating content that worked well
- End of work session (daily habit)

**Time investment**: 2-3 minutes per extraction

**ROI**: 30-45 min saved per pattern application (10-15x return)

## Workflow Overview (7 Steps)

### 1. Identify Recent Work
Ask user what they completed (code/client/content/research). Store work type for categorization.

### 2. Extract Learning
Ask 3-4 targeted questions based on work type:
- Code: Root cause? Solution? Pattern to remember?
- Client: What was unique? What worked well? What surprised you?
- Content: What resonated? What was your process?
- Research: Key insight? How will you apply it?

### 3. Search for Similar Patterns
Grep semantic memory for existing patterns. Decision: NEW pattern or REINFORCEMENT?

### 4. Update Semantic Memory
- **If NEW**: Create pattern entry (LOW confidence, 1 example)
- **If REINFORCEMENT**: Add example, update confidence (may promote LOW→MEDIUM or MEDIUM→HIGH)

### 5. Create Episodic Memory
Log the experience with context, solution, patterns applied, outcome, time saved, and bidirectional links to semantic patterns.

### 6. Update Brain Health Metrics
Update `growth-log.md` (weekly patterns learned, time saved) and `pattern-confidence.md` (confidence level tracking).

### 7. Show Impact
Display pattern update, confidence change, time saved, brain growth stats, and suggest when to apply pattern next.

## Pattern Confidence Levels

| Level | Examples | Status | Promotion |
|-------|----------|--------|-----------|
| **LOW** | 1 | Hypothesis | First occurrence |
| **MEDIUM** | 2-4 | Validated | After 2nd occurrence |
| **HIGH** | 5+ | Mastered | After 5th occurrence |

**Time savings correlation**:
- LOW → MEDIUM: Save 30-60 min on 2nd application
- MEDIUM → HIGH: Save 60-120 min by 5th application
- Expert mode: 80% time reduction

## Memory Types

### Semantic Memory (What You Know)
Abstracted, reusable patterns with confidence levels:
- `dev-patterns.md` - Technical patterns
- `client-patterns.md` - Client-specific patterns
- `content-patterns.md` - Content creation patterns
- `pm-patterns.md` - Product/process patterns

### Episodic Memory (What You've Done)
Specific experiences with dates and outcomes:
- `code/` - Development experiences
- `projects/` - Project milestones
- `content/` - Content created
- `learning/` - Learning experiences

### Procedural Memory (How You Do Things)
Step-by-step workflows and checklists.

**Pattern Flow**: Experience (episodic) → Pattern extraction (semantic) → Future application

## Success Metrics

**Goal**: Compound knowledge - make each project easier

**Weekly Targets** (Week 12):
- 1-3 new patterns captured
- 2-4 hours saved from pattern application
- 30%+ patterns at HIGH confidence
- 80%+ pattern application rate

**ROI Timeline**:
- **Week 1**: Setup (feels manual, "am I doing this right?")
- **Week 4**: Early wins (starts connecting, "oh, I've seen this before")
- **Week 12**: Expert mode (patterns everywhere, "I know exactly what to do")

---

## Integration with Other Commands

### Before: `/recall [topic]`
Search semantic memory before starting work: "Have I solved this before?"

### During: `/switch [project]`
Load project context and related patterns.

### After: `/learn`
Extract pattern from completed work.

### Weekly: `/grow`
Review brain health, celebrate pattern promotions, see cumulative time saved.

## Usage Tips

**Don't over-think it**:
- 2-3 minutes is enough
- Simple answers are fine
- Patterns emerge naturally over time

**Capture broadly, refine later**:
- Don't filter at capture time
- Week 1: Everything feels new
- Week 4: Connections start appearing
- Week 12: Patterns are obvious

**The magic**:
By Week 12, you have expert-level knowledge on 10-20 topics, saving 2-4 hours/week. The 3-minute learning extraction compounds into hours of savings.
