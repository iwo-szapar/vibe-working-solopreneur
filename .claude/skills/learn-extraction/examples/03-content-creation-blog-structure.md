# Example 3: Content Creation - Blog Post Structure Pattern

## Scenario

**Context**: Luca just published a blog post about "AI Adoption Challenges" that performed exceptionally well (3x average engagement). The post took less time to write than usual.

**Work completed**: 1,500-word blog post using a new structure

**Time spent**: 90 minutes (vs. typical 3 hours for similar posts)

**Outcome**: Published post got 450 views in 24 hours, 15 comments, 3 client inquiries ✅

---

## Skill Execution: /learn

### Step 1: Identify Recent Work

**User Input**: `/learn`

**Skill Question**:
```
What did you just complete?

Options:
1. Code work (bug fix, feature, refactor)
2. Client project milestone
3. Content creation (blog, video, social)
4. Research/learning
5. Something else: ________
```

**User Response**: `3. Content creation` (blog post)

**Stored**: `work_type = "content"`

---

### Step 2: Extract Learning (Quick Questions)

**Skill Questions** (for content):

**Q1**: "What topic/format resonated most?"
**A1**: "Problem-first structure: Started with specific pain point ('Why 70% of AI projects fail in procurement'), then data, then solution. Avoided typical 'intro → benefits → conclusion' format."

**Q2**: "What was your process?"
**A2**: "Used a 5-part structure: Hook (pain point) → Data (research) → Why It Matters → Solution Framework → Call to Action. Wrote in that exact order, no rearranging needed."

**Additional Context**: "Noticed readers engaged most with the data section (70% stat) - got 8 comments just on that. Also, writing in order (not jumping around) saved ~90 min."

---

### Step 3: Search for Similar Patterns

**Tool: Grep**
```bash
Grep(
  pattern="blog.*structure|content.*structure",
  path="memory/semantic/patterns/",
  output_mode="files_with_matches"
)
```

**Result**: No matches found

**Decision**: NEW pattern (create entry)

---

### Step 4: Update Semantic Memory

**Domain**: `content-patterns.md` (work_type = content)

**Tool: Read**
```bash
Read("memory/semantic/patterns/content-patterns.md")
```

**Current content**:
```markdown
# Content Creation Patterns

[Other patterns...]
```

**Tool: Edit** (append new pattern)
```bash
Edit(
  file_path="memory/semantic/patterns/content-patterns.md",
  old_string="# Content Creation Patterns\n\n",
  new_string="# Content Creation Patterns\n\n## Problem-First Blog Structure (5-Part Framework)\n\n### Description\nStructure blog posts using problem-first approach: Hook (specific pain point) → Data (research/stats) → Why It Matters → Solution Framework → Call to Action. Write in this exact order to avoid rearranging.\n\n### When to Use\n- Technical blog posts\n- Thought leadership content\n- Problem-solving articles\n- Data-driven content\n\n### Structure Breakdown\n1. **Hook**: Specific pain point question (\"Why 70% of X fail at Y?\")\n2. **Data**: Research, statistics, case studies (credibility)\n3. **Why It Matters**: Connect data to reader's context (relevance)\n4. **Solution Framework**: Actionable steps or principles (value)\n5. **Call to Action**: Next step for reader (engagement)\n\n### Examples\n- Example 1 (2025-01-09): \"AI Adoption Challenges\" post - 450 views in 24h, 15 comments, 3 client inquiries. Wrote in 90 min vs. typical 3 hours.\n\n### Confidence\n- **Level:** LOW\n- **Based on:** 1 example\n- **Created:** 2025-01-09\n\n### Time Savings\n- **Estimated:** ~90 min per application (vs 3 hours with old approach)\n- **Total saved:** 90 min (first instance)\n\n### Sources\n- memory/episodic/content/2025-01-09-ai-adoption-blog.md\n\n### Key Insights\n- Writing in order (no rearranging) saves significant time\n- Data section drives most engagement (readers validate with comments)\n- Problem-first hooks perform better than benefit-first intros\n- Specific pain point questions outperform generic titles\n\n---\n\n"
)
```

**Result**: NEW pattern created with LOW confidence ✅

---

### Step 5: Create Episodic Memory Entry

**Tool: Bash**
```bash
Bash(command="date '+%Y-%m-%d'")
```
**Result**: `2025-01-09`

**Tool: Write**
```bash
Write(
  file_path="memory/episodic/content/2025-01-09-ai-adoption-blog.md",
  content="""
# Blog Post: AI Adoption Challenges - 2025-01-09

## Context
**Project:** Content Marketing - Q1 2025
**Goal:** Write thought leadership blog post on AI adoption challenges
**Duration:** 90 minutes (vs. typical 3 hours)

## What Happened
Wrote 1,500-word blog post: "Why 70% of AI Projects Fail in Procurement (Not Implementation)"

Used new 5-part structure:
1. **Hook** (100 words): "Why do most AI projects die before they start?"
2. **Data** (400 words): Research on procurement vs. implementation failures
3. **Why It Matters** (300 words): Cost of poor procurement processes
4. **Solution Framework** (600 words): 4-step procurement optimization
5. **Call to Action** (100 words): "Audit your procurement process"

## Solution
Applied problem-first structure instead of typical intro → benefits → conclusion format. Wrote sections in exact order (1 → 5) without rearranging.

**Key decisions**:
- Started with specific pain point question (not generic intro)
- Led with data (70% stat) in first 200 words
- Avoided jargon in hook (used "die before they start" not "fail to launch")

## Patterns Applied
- **None** (this was the first instance - pattern originated here)

## Learnings Extracted
- **New pattern**: Problem-First Blog Structure (confidence: LOW)
- Writing in order (no rearranging) saved ~90 min
- Data section drove most engagement (8 comments on 70% stat alone)
- Specific pain point questions outperform benefit-first intros
- Readers validate data with comments (credibility signal)

## Outcome
**Result:** SUCCESS
**Time saved:** 90 min (vs. typical 3-hour writing process)
**Quality:** 9/10 (high engagement, 3 client inquiries)

**Performance**:
- 450 views in 24 hours (3x average)
- 15 comments (5x average)
- 3 client inquiries (1x average is 1-2)
- Top section: Data (8 comments just on 70% stat)

## Linked Patterns
→ Created: memory/semantic/patterns/content-patterns.md#problem-first-blog-structure
→ Confidence: NEW → LOW (1 example)

## Next Time
- Use 5-part structure for all thought leadership posts
- Always lead with specific pain point question
- Write sections in order (don't jump around)
- Include at least 2-3 data points in section 2
- Test different pain point questions (A/B test hooks)

)
```

**Result**: Episodic memory created ✅

## Key Takeaways

**Content pattern extraction**:
1. ✅ Process patterns save as much time as technical patterns
2. ✅ Immediate ROI (90 min saved on first use)
3. ✅ Performance metrics tracked (views, comments, inquiries)
4. ✅ Reusable framework (works across content types)

**Content-specific insights**:
- Problem-first structure outperforms benefit-first
- Data sections drive most engagement (validation behavior)
- Writing in order (no rearranging) saves significant time
- Specific pain point questions > generic titles

**ROI Demonstration**:
- **Week 3**: 90 min saved (first use)
- **Week 5**: 105 min saved (second use, faster with practice)
- **Week 12**: 120 min saved per post (expert-level speed)
- **Cumulative by Week 12**: 8+ hours saved (5 posts × avg 100 min)
- **Net ROI**: Immediate positive ROI (saved time from first use)

**The magic**: By Week 12, Luca has a repeatable content creation system that produces high-performing posts in 60 minutes instead of 3 hours. Every blog post saves 2+ hours while improving engagement.

## Cross-Domain Application

**Interesting note**: This 5-part structure works beyond blog posts:

- **Client proposals**: Hook (problem) → Data (research) → Why It Matters (ROI) → Solution (scope) → CTA (next steps)
- **Sales emails**: Same structure, compressed to 200 words
- **Webinar presentations**: Each section becomes a slide deck module
- **Video scripts**: 5 sections map to 5 video segments

**Future pattern evolution**: This LOW confidence pattern could become a HIGH confidence "Problem-First Communication Framework" applicable across all content types. That's the power of pattern extraction - it compounds across domains.
