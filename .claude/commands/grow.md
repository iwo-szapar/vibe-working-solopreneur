# Brain Growth Report Command

Usage: `/grow`

Show comprehensive report on how Luca's second brain is growing and improving.

## Execution Steps

### Step 1: Count Files in Each Memory Type

**Tool: Bash** (count semantic memory files)
```bash
Bash(command="find memory/semantic/ -type f -name '*.md' | wc -l")
```

**Tool: Bash** (count episodic memory files)
```bash
Bash(command="find memory/episodic/ -type f -name '*.md' | wc -l")
```

**Tool: Bash** (count procedural memory files)
```bash
Bash(command="find memory/procedural/ -type f -name '*.md' | wc -l")
```

**Tool: Bash** (count total memory files)
```bash
Bash(command="find memory/ -type f -name '*.md' | wc -l")
```

**Store as:**
```javascript
const brainSize = {
  semantic: semanticCount,
  episodic: episodicCount,
  procedural: proceduralCount,
  total: totalCount
}
```

### Step 2: Read Pattern Confidence Data

**Tool: Read**
```bash
Read("brain-health/pattern-confidence.md")
```

**Parse content:**
```javascript
// Count patterns by confidence level
const highConfidencePatterns = countSections("## High Confidence")
const mediumConfidencePatterns = countSections("## Medium Confidence")
const lowConfidencePatterns = countSections("## Low Confidence")

const totalPatterns = highConfidencePatterns + mediumConfidencePatterns + lowConfidencePatterns
```

### Step 3: Read Growth Log for Weekly Comparison

**Tool: Read**
```bash
Read("brain-health/growth-log.md")
```

**Extract current week data:**
```javascript
// Find latest week entry
const currentWeek = parseLatestWeek(content)
const lastWeek = parsePreviousWeek(content)

const growth = {
  patternsAdded: currentWeek.patterns - lastWeek.patterns,
  filesAdded: currentWeek.files - lastWeek.files,
  semanticAdded: currentWeek.semantic - lastWeek.semantic,
  episodicAdded: currentWeek.episodic - lastWeek.episodic
}
```

### Step 4: Read Time Savings Metrics

**Tool: Read**
```bash
Read("brain-health/metrics.md")
```

**Extract:**
```javascript
// Parse metrics file for time savings
const timeSavings = {
  thisWeek: parseTimeSaved("this week"),
  total: parseTimeSaved("cumulative"),
  averagePerPattern: parseAverage("per pattern application")
}
```

### Step 5: Count Projects

**Tool: Read**
```bash
Read("projects/INDEX.md")
```

**Parse:**
```javascript
// Count active vs archived projects
const activeProjects = countProjects("## Active")
const archivedProjects = countProjects("## Archived")
```

### Step 6: Analyze Pattern Usage (Top Patterns)

**Tool: Grep** (search for pattern applications in episodic memory)
```bash
Grep(
  pattern="Pattern applied:",
  path="memory/episodic/",
  output_mode="content"
)
```

**Aggregate:**
```javascript
// Count how many times each pattern was applied
const patternUsage = aggregatePatternApplications(grepResults)

// Sort by frequency
const topPatterns = patternUsage.sort((a, b) => b.count - a.count).slice(0, 3)
```

### Step 7: Identify Domain Coverage

**Tool: Grep** (count patterns by domain)
```bash
Grep(
  pattern="dev-patterns",
  path="memory/semantic/patterns/",
  output_mode="count"
)

Grep(
  pattern="content-patterns",
  path="memory/semantic/patterns/",
  output_mode="count"
)

Grep(
  pattern="pm-patterns",
  path="memory/semantic/patterns/",
  output_mode="count"
)
```

**Build domain breakdown:**
```javascript
const domains = {
  dev: devPatternsCount,
  content: contentPatternsCount,
  pm: pmPatternsCount
}
```

### Step 8: Calculate Annual Projections

**Based on current metrics:**
```javascript
const weeksActive = calculateWeeksSinceStart()
const averageTimeSavedPerWeek = timeSavings.total / weeksActive
const projectedAnnualSavings = averageTimeSavedPerWeek * 52
```

### Step 9: Generate Recommendations

**Based on usage patterns:**
```javascript
// Check for opportunities
IF patternApplicationsThisWeek < 3:
  recommend("Run /learn more often after completing work")

IF similarIdeasCount > 3:
  recommend("Consolidate related ideas into one pattern")

IF projectsActive > 5:
  recommend("Consider archiving inactive projects")

IF timeSavingsGrowthRate < 0:
  recommend("Focus on applying existing patterns more consistently")
```

### Step 10: Format and Display Report

**Output structure:**

Consider creating: `skills/competitive-positioning/`
**Estimated benefit:** Save 1 hour per occurrence

### 📚 Consolidate Knowledge
You have 3 separate learnings about "pricing objections."
Consider merging into one pattern in: `memory/semantic/patterns/pm-patterns.md`
**Benefit:** Easier to recall and apply

### ⭐ Promote Example
Your recent one-pager for Acme Corp is excellent (9.5/10 quality).
Add to: `memory/examples/winning-one-pagers/`
**Benefit:** Future one-pagers will match this quality

```

## Success Metrics

**Goal:** Compound knowledge - make each project easier

**Metrics:**
- Report generation time: < 5 seconds
- Accuracy: 100% (based on actual files/data)
- Actionable insights: 3-5 recommendations per run

## When to Run /grow

**Weekly recommended:**
- Every Friday afternoon
- Review week's progress
- Celebrate wins
- Plan next week improvements

**Monthly recommended:**
- First day of new month
- Review cumulative progress
- Measure against 6-month goals
- Adjust strategy if needed

**Ad-hoc:**
- When feeling like "is this working?"
- Before meetings with boss (show ROI)
- After major milestones
- When deciding what to optimize next

## Required Files

**Structure:**
```
brain-health/
├── pattern-confidence.md    # Pattern confidence levels
├── growth-log.md            # Weekly growth tracking
└── metrics.md               # Time savings and other KPIs

memory/
├── semantic/
├── episodic/
└── procedural/

projects/
└── INDEX.md
```

## Edge Cases

### First Week (No Historical Data)

**If no previous week data:**
```markdown
📊 **Total:** 15 files (first week - no comparison)

**Note:** Run /grow next week to see growth trends!
```

### No Patterns Yet

**If zero patterns:**
```markdown
💡 **Get started:**
1. Complete work on a project
2. Run /learn to extract first pattern
3. Run /grow next week to see progress
```

## Notes for Luca

**Use for motivation:**
- See tangible progress (patterns growing)
- Measure real time savings (not guesses)
- Celebrate milestones (25, 50, 100 patterns)

**Use for ROI proof:**
- Show boss: "Saved 217 hours this year"
- Justify time investment in setup
- Demonstrate system value

**Use for optimization:**
- Identify which patterns save most time
- See which domains need more patterns
- Know when to build integrations

**The magic:**
- Week 1: "Am I doing this right?" (feels manual)
- Week 4: "Oh, it's working!" (seeing savings)
- Week 12: "Can't imagine working without it" (addicted to growth)
