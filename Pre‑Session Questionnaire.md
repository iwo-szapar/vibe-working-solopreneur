# Claude Code "Second Brain" — Pre‑Session Questionnaire & Brief


**Session date/time:** 12/11/2025, 10-12pm GTM+2
**Duration:** 2 hours


---


## Context & Vision — Why You're Here


These open-ended questions help me understand your bigger picture and tailor the session to your actual needs.


**A. What sparked your interest in building a "second brain" now?**
What's changed or what pain point brought you here? (e.g., "drowning in client requests," "team keeps asking me the same questions," "want to scale my consulting practice," "competitors are using AI and I'm not").


**Answer:** I use Claude daily in my full time job, as well as in a new business venture that I am building on the side. I am doing a lot of coding in both areas, but I would really like to speed up and enhance the work I am doing in my own business. I am not a coder, but have been involved in the industry for many years so have a pretty good idea of what I want to accomplish so have been able to make really good progress over the last few months. I did a bunch of documentation generation with Claude Code on my C# project, so we have quite a lot to work with along with some clear deliverables to aim at. I need to enhance the ways of work as the project is increasing in complexity and needs a new fresh way of work and I believe that Claude Code is the way to achieve this.


**B. Personal tool or team asset?**
Are you building this for yourself, or do you envision your team/colleagues using it eventually?


* [ ] **Personal only** — Just me, my workflows
* [ ] **Personal first, team later** — Start with me, expand if it works
* [ ] **Team from day one** — Multiple people will use this
* [ ] **Hybrid** — Some personal, some shared: __________


**Answer/Notes:** Personal first, team later (possibly)


**C. High-level use case categories (check all that apply)**
What domains will this second brain help with?


* [ ] **Client work** (proposals, briefs, reports, deliverables)
* [ ] **Research & analysis** (market research, competitive intel, data synthesis)
* [ ] **Content creation** (writing, presentations, social media)
* [ ] **Operations** (project management, status updates, meeting notes)
* [ ] **Sales & outreach** (prospecting, follow-ups, relationship management)
* [ ] **Learning & knowledge management** (onboarding, training, documentation)
* [ ] **Strategic planning** (business strategy, roadmaps, decision support)
* [ ] **Other:** Code generation, with some elements of the many other areas


**D. Six-month vision**
If this works perfectly, what changes in your day-to-day life six months from now? (be specific: hours saved, stress reduced, new opportunities, revenue impact, team dynamics).


**Answer:** Ideally, if this works out it helps build my own business a lot faster and more efficiently. I firmly believe that the tools are available, and without adapting and evolving my long term vision of creating financial freedom for my family and myself will not be achievable.


**E. Stakeholders & expansion**
If this second brain proves valuable, who else might use it or benefit from a similar setup? (colleagues, team members, clients, partners).


**Answer:** There are multiple other parties who I believe could benefit from it. My business partner would be at the top of the list, and I would look to share it with my direct team in my full time job as well.


**F. Concerns or constraints**
What worries you most about building this? What could go wrong? (e.g., "won't stay up to date," "too complex to maintain," "team won't adopt it," "confidential data risks").


**Answer:** Information security is always something that is a lingering concern but I at the moment the trade off is far too great to let that be a show stopper. The speed of which the technology is evolving is incredibly difficult to keep up with so staying relevant and understanding all the intricacies is an ever present concern.

## MAIN OPENING — Define Success


1. **Session success (how you’ll judge it)**
  What must be true by the end of the session for you to call it a win? (be specific: speed, quality, reliability, confidence, fewer errors, etc.)
  **Answer:** A new way of work that will create speed, efficiency and a smarter end result in the code that I generate - fewer errors, less time wasted as a result of a more context aware build process.


2. **Day‑one deliverable**
  What tangible output should the system produce immediately after the session? (e.g., “proposal draft in 10 min,” “weekly research brief,” “client summary pack”).
  **Answer:** A better, more accurate and efficient way to write code - less copy and paste from browser to IDE

4. **Biggest issues with Claude Code**
  What blocks you most right now? (e.g., setup, memory, context drift, repo structure, MCPs, reliability).
  **Answer:** Conversation limits in the browser session which results in new conversations needing to be started, which means loss of context despite master prompts and project knowledge context documentation


5. **Features you've used — checklist + explain**
  Tick what you've actually used. For any box you tick, briefly explain how.


* [ ] **Subagents** — *How you used them:* No

  **Optional — Share repo access for prep?**
  Would you be willing to give me read access before the session so I can review your setup and personalize our approach? (I completely understand if not due to confidential/proprietary content.)


  * [ ] **Yes, happy to share** — GitHub username to invite: __________
  * [ ] **No, prefer to keep private** — No problem! We can review together live
  * [ ] **Partial** — I can share [specific parts/screenshots]: __________


  💡 **Benefit if you share**: I can identify what's already working, spot quick wins, and come prepared with specific recommendations for your exact setup.
