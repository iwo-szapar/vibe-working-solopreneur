## 📊 Sprint Summary

**Sprint Duration:** 1 week (Nov 10-16)
**Total Tasks:** 10
**Urgent:** 3 🔴
**High:** 3 🟠
**Normal:** 3 🟢
**Low:** 1 🔵

**Estimated Hours This Sprint:** 33 hours
**Available Hours:** 10 hours (weekday mornings + Sunday)
**Overflow:** 23 hours

**Capacity Issue:** SEVERELY overcommitted (3.3x capacity)

**Adjustment Plan:**
1. Defer Task #6 (Email sequence) to next sprint (can launch without automated sequence)
2. Reduce Task #1 (Module 1 editing) scope: Only edit 3.3-3.5 (rest can wait)
3. Hire editor on Fiverr for Module 1 editing (Tasks #1) - Save 4 hours, cost $100
4. **Adjusted hours:** 33 - 2 - 2 - 4 = 25 hours (still 15 hours over)
5. Extend sprint to 2 weeks (Nov 10-23) - 20 hours available
6. **Final adjusted:** 25 hours over 2 weeks = 12.5 hrs/week (within capacity)

**Realistic Next 2 Weeks:**
- ✅ Task #1: Module 1 editing (outsource to Fiverr editor) - 2 hrs my time
- ✅ Task #2: Film Module 3 remaining lessons - 6 hrs
- ✅ Task #3: Sales page copy - 4 hrs
- ✅ Task #4: Hire designer for sales page - 2 hrs
- ✅ Task #5: Create cheatsheet PDF - 3 hrs
- ⏸️ Task #6: Email sequence (defer to Week 8)
- **Total:** 17 hours (within 20-hour capacity)

---

**Critical Path:**
- Module 1 editing (Task #1) → Can upload to YouTube (Task #8)
- Sales page copy (Task #3) → Designer can start (Task #4) → Sales page live
- Cheatsheet PDF (Task #5) → Email list growth → Launch success

**Risk:**
- Launch date Dec 15 is tight (6 weeks remaining, 3 modules left to film + edit)
- Consider pushing to Jan 5, 2026 (post-holidays, less competition)
- Mitigation: Focus on quality over speed, delay is okay

---

**Notes:**
- Quality > speed (better to delay launch than ship mediocre course)
- Beta testers love content so far (builds confidence)
- Video editing is bottleneck (consider hiring editor for all future modules)
- Marketing is uncomfortable but necessary (tweet progress weekly)
