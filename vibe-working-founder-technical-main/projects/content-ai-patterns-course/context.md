# Content Project - AI Development Patterns Course

**Project Type:** Content Creation / Education
**Status:** Active Production
**Timeline:** Oct 2025 - Dec 2025 (3 months)
**Last Updated:** 2025-11-10

---

## Project Overview

**Course Name:** "AI Development Patterns: Building with GPT-4 and Claude"
**Format:** Video course + written tutorials + GitHub repo
**Target Platform:** Gumroad (self-hosted) + YouTube (free samples)

**Elevator Pitch:**
Practical course teaching developers how to integrate AI into real applications. Covers prompt engineering, RAG, agents, error handling, and cost optimization through battle-tested patterns.

**Target Audience:**
- Senior developers building AI features
- Technical founders adding AI to products
- Engineering teams adopting AI tools

**Unique Angle:**
Not theory – real patterns from production systems (e-commerce, analytics, SaaS). Each pattern includes: problem → solution → code → when to use → cost analysis.

## Constraints & Challenges

**Time Constraints:**
- Solo creator (no team, all me)
- 10 hours/week available (mornings + Sunday)
- Must launch by Dec 15, 2025 (holiday shoppers)
- Already behind schedule (originally planned Oct launch)

**Quality Constraints:**
- High production quality (compete with paid courses)
- Code examples must work (nothing worse than broken tutorials)
- Clear explanations (developers hate fluff)

**Business Constraints:**
- Limited marketing budget ($500 for ads)
- Small audience (300 Twitter followers, 150 email list)
- First course (no proven track record)

**Current Blockers:**
- Video editing taking 3x longer than expected (2 hours footage = 6 hours editing)
- AI agents module needs more research (haven't built this in production yet)
- Launch date approaching fast (6 weeks remaining)

## Key Decisions

**Course Decisions:**
1. **Why Gumroad?** Simple setup, no course platform fees, own customer data
2. **Why video + code?** Developers learn by doing, need both explanation + code
3. **Why real patterns?** Too many AI courses are theoretical, mine is practical
4. **Why $129?** Premium pricing (signals quality), targets teams with budgets

**Content Decisions:**
1. **Focus on patterns** - Not "how to use ChatGPT" but "how to integrate AI into real apps"
2. **Show costs** - Every pattern includes $ analysis (developers care about budget)
3. **Battle-tested** - Only patterns I've used in production (3 client projects + FlowStack)
4. **Evergreen** - Patterns apply across AI models (not just GPT-4)

**Marketing Decisions:**
1. **Build in public** - Tweet progress weekly (build anticipation)
2. **Free samples on YouTube** - 3 lessons free to showcase quality
3. **Email list** - Collect emails with free "AI Patterns Cheatsheet" PDF
4. **Affiliate program** - 30% commission (other devs promote for me)

## Notes & Learnings

**What's Going Well:**
- Content quality high (beta testers love it)
- Real examples resonate (practical > theoretical)
- Code repo structure clean (easy to follow)
- Filming easier than expected (2 takes max per lesson)

**What's Challenging:**
- Video editing slow (6 hours per 1 hour of content)
- AI agents module needs more research (haven't built this yet)
- Marketing difficult (small audience, feels awkward promoting myself)
- Launch date pressure (Dec 15 is tight, considering Jan 5)

**Patterns Discovered:**
- Script → Film → Edit in batches (context switching kills productivity)
- Morning filming best (fresh voice, clear thinking)
- Edit next day (fresh eyes catch mistakes)
- Beta tester feedback invaluable (caught 3 confusing explanations)

**Personal Insights:**
- Teaching forces deep understanding (explaining ≠ knowing)
- Showing real code (even messy) more valuable than perfect examples
- Developers appreciate honesty about costs, limitations
- Building in public creates accountability (can't quit when people watching)

- Help developers (genuinely want to share what I learned)

**Success Definition:**
- $15k revenue in 3 months (covers 1 month of lost client time)
- 100+ students finding value (testimonials, Twitter mentions)
- Establish me as "AI patterns expert" (more consulting opps)
- Feels fun, not draining (learning + teaching > pure client work)

**If It Fails:**
- Learnings: Video production, course marketing, sales funnels
- Content marketing: Blog posts attract clients anyway
- Portfolio: Shows depth of knowledge
- Pivot: Turn into subscription (new patterns monthly) or coaching
