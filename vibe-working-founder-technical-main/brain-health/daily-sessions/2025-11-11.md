## Today's Top 3 Priorities

Based on current project tasks and business priorities, here are your recommended priorities:

**Priority 1** (Morning deep work): Optimize dashboard query - currently timing out for large datasets
- Best Time: Your highest focus hours (morning deep work block)
- Estimated Time: 3 hours
- Why Urgent: Due TODAY, blocking user experience
- Energy Required: HIGH (complex optimization work)
- Success Metric: Query completes in <2s for all dataset sizes

**Priority 2** (Afternoon): Implement WebSocket connection pooling
- Best Time: After lunch, moderate focus required
- Estimated Time: 2 hours
- Why Important: Performance improvement, prevents resource exhaustion
- Energy Required: MEDIUM (technical implementation)
- Success Metric: Connection pool manages 100+ concurrent users

**Priority 3** (End of day): Add data retention policy (90 days)
- Best Time: End of day or tomorrow morning
- Estimated Time: 4 hours
- Why Important: Data governance, storage optimization
- Energy Required: MEDIUM (policy implementation + testing)
- Success Metric: Automated cleanup runs daily, retains 90 days

## Alignment Check

**Business Priority Questions:**
1. Does Priority 1 directly impact revenue or client satisfaction?
   - YES - Query timeouts are blocking dashboard usage

2. Are these tasks aligned with project timeline?
   - YES - Client B Analytics Dashboard beta deadline: 2025-02-15

3. Is anything urgent from other projects being ignored?
   - Check via `/overview` if managing multiple projects

**Capacity Reality Check:**
- Total estimated time: 9 hours (Priority 1-3)
- Realistic today: ~6 hours (accounting for meetings, breaks, context switches)
- Recommendation: Focus on Priority 1 (URGENT), start Priority 2 if time allows

## Execution Plan

### Morning Block (9:00 AM - 12:00 PM)
**Task:** Priority 1 - Optimize dashboard query
**Approach:**
1. Profile current query performance (identify bottleneck)
2. Review database indexes on MongoDB
3. Implement query optimization (aggregation pipeline)
4. Test with large datasets
5. Deploy to staging

### Afternoon Block (1:00 PM - 4:00 PM)
**Task:** Priority 2 - WebSocket connection pooling (if Priority 1 completed)
**Approach:**
1. Research WebSocket pooling patterns
2. Implement connection pool manager
3. Update client connection logic
4. Load test with 100+ concurrent connections
5. Monitor resource usage

### End of Day (4:00 PM - 5:00 PM)
**Task:** Wrap-up and planning
- Document what got done
- Update tasks.md
- Prepare for evening check-out session

## Notes & Blockers

**Known Blockers:**
- None identified yet

**Questions to Address:**
- What's the root cause of query timeout? (indexes? aggregation? data volume?)

**Resources Needed:**
- Access to MongoDB Atlas performance metrics
- Staging environment for testing
