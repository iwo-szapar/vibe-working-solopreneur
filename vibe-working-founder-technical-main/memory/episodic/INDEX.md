# Episodic Memory - What You've Done

This folder stores **specific experiences** - concrete projects, tasks, and work you've completed.

## Structure

### code/
Development work completed
- File format: `YYYY-MM-DD-brief-description.md`
- Examples: `2025-01-09-oauth-bug-fix.md`, `2025-01-05-feature-product-filters.md`

### projects/
Major project milestones and deliverables
- Client launches, feature releases, major refactors

### content/
Content you've created
- Blog posts written, videos recorded, social media campaigns

### learning/
Learning experiences and research
- Courses completed, technologies explored, experiments

## How This Works

**Automatic logging:**
- After completing work, experiences saved here
- `/learn` command creates experience files
- Links to patterns in semantic memory

**What to capture:**
- What you did (brief description)
- Why you did it (context, goal)
- How you did it (approach, patterns applied)
- What you learned (new insights, patterns)
- Time saved (if pattern applied)
- Next time (what to remember)

## Experience File Format

```markdown
# [Task Name] - [Date]

## Context
**Project:** [Project name]
**Goal:** [What needed to be done]
**Duration:** [Time spent]

## What Happened
[Brief description of work]

## Patterns Applied
- [Pattern 1]: [How used]
- [Pattern 2]: [How used]

## Learnings Extracted
- [Learning 1]: [Description]
- [Learning 2]: [Description]

## Outcome
**Result:** [Success/failure/partial]
**Time saved:** [If pattern applied] X min
**Quality:** [Better/same/needs improvement]

## Linked Patterns
→ Updated: memory/semantic/patterns/[pattern-name].md
→ Confidence: [Increased/New/Unchanged]
```

## Purpose

**Pattern extraction:**
- Multiple similar experiences → Pattern
- Pattern → Applied to future work
- Future work → Faster, better quality

**Progress tracking:**
- See what you've accomplished
- Measure growth over time
- Celebrate wins

**Knowledge source:**
- Reference past work
- Remember how you solved problems
- Avoid repeating mistakes

## Cross-References

Episodic memory → generates → Semantic memory
- Similar experiences become patterns
- Patterns increase in confidence
- Knowledge compounds over time
