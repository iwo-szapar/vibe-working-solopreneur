## Low Priority Ideas 🟢

### "Technical Founder's Handbook" Book

**Priority:** 🟢 Low
**Captured:** 2025-01-11
**Source:** Luca's 20+ years of technical founder experience + second brain patterns
**Estimated effort:** 6-12 months to write (100-200 pages)
**Potential revenue:** $5K-$20K (self-published) or $50K+ advance (traditional publisher)
**Next step:** Build audience first via blog/LinkedIn, then write book proposal

**Book concept:**
- **Title:** "The AI-Augmented Founder: Building a Second Brain for Technical Leadership"
- **Audience:** Technical founders managing 3-5+ projects, experiencing context overload
- **Core thesis:** Traditional productivity advice doesn't work for technical founders - you need a "second brain" that compounds knowledge
- **Structure:**
  - Part 1: The Context Overload Problem (Luca's story)
  - Part 2: Second Brain Architecture (3-layer system)
  - Part 3: AI Augmentation Strategies (40% → 100% augmentation)
  - Part 4: Real-World Workflows (dev, PM, content, idea-capture)
  - Part 5: Case Studies (Luca + 5 other technical founders)

**Why low priority:**
- **Time investment**: 6-12 months (can't afford this now)
- **Uncertain ROI**: Books rarely make significant money
- **Better to build audience first**: 1,000+ LinkedIn followers, 5K+ blog readers
- **Use as "lead magnet"**: Book establishes authority, drives consulting business

**Milestone-based approach:**
- **Milestone 1:** 50 blog posts published (content foundation)
- **Milestone 2:** 5,000 LinkedIn followers (audience validation)
- **Milestone 3:** 20 "second brain setup" clients (case studies)
- **Milestone 4:** Then write book proposal (leverage proof of demand)

**Status:**
- [ ] Backlog (revisit in 12-18 months)
- [ ] Focus on blog/LinkedIn first (build audience)
- [ ] Document Luca's journey in real-time (becomes book content later)

### SaaS: "SecondBrain.dev" Platform

**Priority:** 🟢 Low
**Captured:** 2025-01-11
**Source:** Long-term vision for scalable second brain product
**Estimated effort:** 6-12 months full-time development
**Potential revenue:** $10K-$50K MRR (Year 2-3)
**Next step:** Validate demand via consulting service first (20+ paying setup clients)

**Product vision:**
- **What:** Web-based second brain platform built on Claude Code architecture
- **Turnkey setup:** No command line required (vs. current Claude Code CLI)
- **Persona-based onboarding:** Choose your workflow (dev, PM, content creator, founder)
- **Pricing tiers:**
  - Solo: $29/mo (1 user, 5 projects, 10GB storage)
  - Team: $99/mo (up to 5 users, unlimited projects, 100GB storage, shared patterns)
  - Enterprise: $299/mo (unlimited users, SSO, custom integrations, dedicated support)

**Why low priority:**
- **High development cost**: 6-12 months full-time (can't afford opportunity cost now)
- **Market risk**: Second brain category is crowded (Notion, Obsidian, Roam, etc.)
- **Need proof of demand first**: Validate via consulting (20+ paying clients = proven demand)
- **Better to start with services**: Consulting → Productized service → SaaS (de-risk each step)

**Validation pathway:**
1. **Phase 1** (Months 1-6): Run "Second Brain Setup" consulting (target: 20 paying clients)
2. **Phase 2** (Months 7-12): Track retention (do clients keep using it after 30/60/90 days?)
3. **Phase 3** (Months 13-18): Identify common pain points (what's manual that should be automated?)
4. **Phase 4** (Months 19-24): Build MVP SaaS based on real user needs (not assumptions)

**Status:**
- [ ] Backlog (revisit in 18-24 months)
- [ ] Focus on consulting validation first
