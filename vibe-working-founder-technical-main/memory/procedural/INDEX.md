# Procedural Memory - How You Do Things

This folder stores **workflows and processes** - step-by-step procedures for common tasks.

## Structure

### workflows/
Defined workflows for repetitive tasks
- Populated by use cases (dev-workflow, content-chain-workflow, etc.)
- Step-by-step instructions
- When to use each workflow

## How This Grows

**From use cases:**
- Each use case installs workflows here
- Example: `dev-workflow` adds code review workflow
- Example: `content-chain-workflow` adds blog-to-social workflow

**From patterns:**
- High-confidence patterns become workflows
- Codified processes from repeated work
- Checklists and templates

## Purpose

- **Consistency:** Do things the same way every time
- **Efficiency:** Don't reinvent process each time
- **Quality:** Follow proven procedures
- **Onboarding:** If someone joins, they can follow your workflows

## Example Workflows

- OAuth setup procedure
- Code review checklist
- Blog post creation process
- Client onboarding workflow
- Weekly planning routine

## Cross-References

Patterns (semantic) → mature into → Workflows (procedural)
- Pattern: "Always do X when Y"
